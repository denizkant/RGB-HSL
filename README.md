# RGB-HSL
The purpose of this project is to create 2 functions that convert RGB values to HSL and convert HSL values to RGB. Both functions are called in main. Instead of using 3 x 4 byte int as input, 1byte value uint8_t is used.

The HSL value seen above in this photo is the output of the RGBtoHSL function. The RGB seen below is the output of the HSLtoRGB function. Both are given the same values to check. Since it was converted to double inte (casting), the values were close to each other.
